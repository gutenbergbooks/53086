<h2>The Inventor<br />

<small>Introducing the Wishing Box</small><br />

<span class="small">A CHRISTMAS PLAY</span></h2>


<h3>SCENE AND PROPERTIES REQUIRED.</h3>

<p>The sitting room of Faraway Farm. Rocking chairs, table
covered with red cloth or oilcloth, braided rugs, small mirror
hanging on wall, beneath which are comb and brush. Lantern,
carpet slippers, books, and large box (see suggestions).</p>


<h3>CHARACTERS AND COSTUMES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span>—Ordinary street clothes, long overcoat, and afterward
cap with college band. Carries college flag, after he comes from
the Wishing Box.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith.</span>—Dressed as girl of fourteen in traveling costume.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt Susan.</span>—Gingham dress, white apron, white wig.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner.</span>—Old suit, blue overalls, boots, afterwards removed
for carpet slippers. After he comes from the Wishing Box wears
checked suit, gay necktie, derby and carries “sample” case of
soap and perfumes.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Miss Wise.</span>—  } Teachers. Long cloaks and veils.<br />
<span class="smcap">Miss Markus.</span>—}<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Miss Priscilla.</span>—} Spinsters. Old-fashioned dress, carry<br />

<p><span class="smcap">Rastus</span> (2) White face.—Same size boy, costumed identically.
He takes Rastus’ place, as provided in the play.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inventor.</span>—Should be dressed to suggest “absent-mindedness,”
as, for example, a tan shoe on one foot and a black one
on the other, gloves on wrong hands, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>


<h3>GENERAL SUGGESTIONS.</h3>

<p>The magic wishing box is a large packing box, lettered
“Wishing Box Patent Applied For.” Across the rear of the
platform a dark curtain is stretched, making as it were a false
wall to the room. This conceals the box until it is needed, and
affords opportunity for the characters to make the necessary
changes in their costumes. One side of the box, also the top
are removed, so that the characters may enter the box through
the top, using a small stepladder if necessary, and come out
again quickly, being enabled to change their costumes and
receive the necessary accessories through the side which has
been removed. It is important that everything necessary for the
change of costume should be in readiness. In the case of the
Pullman porter it will be found advisable to substitute for
“Rastus,” a boy costumed in exactly the same manner but with
face unblackened.</p>

<h2>ACT I.</h2>


<p>(Curtain rises. Aunt Susan seated near table with knitting
in hand.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt Susan</span> (laying down knitting).—Dear, dear, it’s
snowing still. This will certainly be a white Christmas. (Resumes
work.) I must hurry and finish this sock for Abner.
He’s been such a faithful hired boy, and I don’t know of a thing
that would please him better for Christmas than a pair of nice
red socks. (Holds them up to view.) (Knits a few moments.)
They’re finished now, and I know he’ll be plumb tickled. He
did say somethin’ about a baseball an’ bat, but these here socks
are better. I must wrap them up in paper. Where’s that piece
the meat came in? (Rises and searches, at last finding it.) I
don’t believe in this new-fangled nonsense about red ribbon and
holly tags for wrapping presents. (Wraps socks in meat paper.)</p>

<p>(Enter Abner, whistling, sets down lantern, takes off boots
and puts on bright colored carpet slippers. Goes to mirror and
combs hair.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner.</span>—The chores are all done now, thank goodness.
Where’s that book I wuz readin’, “Wyoming Will, the Hero
of Gold Gulch?” (Searches on table and finds it. Sits down
to read.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span>—Did you shut the henhouse door and lock the
stable?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner.</span>—Yes, ma’am. I got up at three o’clock this morning,
an’ I swept the barn an’ fed the horses an’ cows an’ pigs
an’ chickens, an’ did the milkin’, an’ shoveled paths, an’ split
kindlin’ an sawed wood, an’ cleaned the harness, an’ got the
mail, an’ shoveled some more, an’ mended the sleigh, an’ did
the evening chores, an’ now it’s nine an’ I’m through. (Sighs.)
Nothin’ to do till to-morrow. Ain’t I the lucky guy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span>—Yes, Abner, you are a right lucky boy to be hired
man here I can tell you, an’ I hope you won’t be foolish an’ run
away to the city. You may be plumb thankful you have to
work. Do you know who finds mischief for idle hands?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner</span> (promptly).—Yes, ma’am, you do. I know what
I’d do if I had a lot of money, though.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span>—What would you do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner.</span>—I’d go to a high-class hotel an’ hire a number-one
room, an’ leave orders to be called at three.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span>—That’s a crazy notion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner.</span>—Then, when they knocked on my door, I’d say,
Nix, I don’t have to get up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span>—Hark! I hear someone at the gate. I hope it
ain’t a tramp. I ain’t got no time for those fellers that don’t
want to work between meals. Cut out the meals, I say, if that’s
the case.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner.</span>—You’ve got as much sympathy for them as you
have for me. The only place <i>I</i> find sympathy is in the
dictionary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span>—Don’t stop to talk, Abner, but open the door.</p>

<p>(Abner reluctantly lays down his book and rises.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner.</span>—Got to tend door, too. Next thing I’ll have to
wear a frilly apron and a dinky little cap. Miss Susan is sure
the President of the Society for the Prevention of Leisure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice.</span>—Anybody home?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner.</span>—Nobody but the lamp and that’s going out.</p>

<p>(Opens door and enter storm-bound party.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner.</span>—Well, I swan! Are you sure you’re all here and
ain’t left anybody setting down in the snow? (A thought strikes
him.) If this is a surprise for Miss Susan, you’re a week too
late for her seventy-eighth birthday was last Wednesday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span>—Abner! Aren’t you ashamed of yourself! Seventy-eighth
birthday!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith.</span>—We really must apologize for coming in this—er—this—what
IS the word I want?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span>—Nervy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith.</span>—No, indeed. I mean unceremonious. That’s it.
This unceremonious fashion. We are passengers on the Limited,
and it is stalled in the snow half a mile below here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span>—We’ve been late the last six hours, for the train before
was behind, and we were behind before besides.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith.</span>—We hated to spend Christmas eve in a snow bank,
half frozen, and the conductor said it would be at least two hours
before the plows could reach us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span>—So, when we saw the lights of your farm-house, we
invited ourselves, and we hope you will accept the invitation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span>—Well, this is a surprise party, an’ I am plumb
pleased to see you folks, for I wuz lonesome here by myself. I
wouldn’t want nobody a-celebratin’ Christmas eve in a snow
bank. I thought I heard that train a-whistlin’ there awhile ago,
an’ yet I didn’t hear it go past; they’re company for me, them
trains, though I fought considerable agin the track crossing my
land. Their fust plan was to have the tracks run right through
my barn, and I set my foot on that. No, sir, says I. I ain’t
goin’ to get up all hours of the night at my age, to open the
barn doors to let them trains through, an’ shut ’em after they
pass. I guess that made them railroad men change their plans.
Abner, take the folks’ coats an’ hats. Sit down all of you an’
get thawed out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Prudence.</span>—Be careful of that hat, young man. I’ve
worn it six years. (Removes hat and hands it to him.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith.</span>—Why, I get a new one every season. Last Easter
I had such a pretty one, all trimmed with pansies, and the
milliner sent it home in a paper bag. Uncle Reuben opened the
door and took it in, for I had gone to bed. He thought it was
flowers, so he put it to soak in the dishpan all night, and you
should have seen it in the morning.</p>

<p>(Abner lays down pile of wraps and proceeds to try on
Tom’s hat and overcoat. “Business” of examining wraps,
trying on hats, while whistling—</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 474px;">
<img src="images/music.jpg" width="474" height="69" alt="Music" />
</div><div class="center"><small>[<i>Transcriber's Note: You can play this music (mp3 file) by clicking</i> <a href="music/inventor.mp3">here</a>.]</small></div>

<p class="unindent">or something monotonous which should be introduced at every
opportunity. Whistle “off the key” as much as possible. The
others whisper to each other, moving quietly, to positions away
from centre, to right and left.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner.</span>—Now I can get the latest city styles better than
Bill Barker’s mail-order catalogue that he was reading out of last
night. These clothes have sure got some class to them. If
Lorena Boggs had seen me now she wouldn’t have gone to the
picnic with the soap salesmen, she’d have gone with yours truly.
(Puts on hat.) This is I reckon one of them there fried egg
derbies that’s so nifty. Yes, sir, if I’d been togged up in these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
here instead of them hand-me-downs of Miss Susan’s brother’s.
(Miss Susan approaches him.) I’d have gone up to Lorena, and
taken off my hat like this an’ said—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Susan</span> (sharply).—Don’t be a fool!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner</span> (as if surprised).—No, ma’am, I wouldn’t said that
to Lorena at all!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Susan</span> (in irritation).—Haven’t you any sense?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner.</span>—No, ma’am, nor dollars either, seeing as I earn
ten dollars a month and there ain’t no raise of salary visible to
the naked eye.</p>

<p>(Exit with wraps, whistling).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Priscilla</span> (advancing).—I am certainly glad to be
here, for I’m always so nervous when traveling. I’m afraid of
losing my ticket. That reminds me—I wonder if I have it
now! (Opens valise and nervously takes out miscellaneous
articles. Shakes her head. Replaces articles. Opens hand
bag, and finds ticket.) Thank goodness, here it is!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span>—I lost my ticket once and when I told the conductor
I was traveling on my face he said he always punched his fares,
and guessed I wasn’t going very far.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith.</span>—I get nervous, too, and when I was in England
with Cousin Lydia, I had two bags and a rug, and I asked the
porter if he had seen two rags and a bug.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Prudence</span> (looking about her).—How delightfully
comfortable it is here, and how charming your old-fashioned
furniture is. We don’t see anything like it nowadays.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span>—No, modern furniture is on the instalment plan;
pay a dollar down and a dollar a week till death us do part.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Priscilla.</span>—If you will permit us, Miss Susan, we
will continue our fancy work, for we are somewhat belated with
our Christmas gifts. (Abner enters.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Susan.</span>—No need to offer excuses, ladies, for I like to
see folks busy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner</span> (with earnestness).—Yes, ma’am, you do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Prudence.</span>—I was reading in a magazine article
recently that a business man should always be well-dressed, and
as my nephew has recently accepted a position with a large firm,
I am making him a handsome necktie for business wear. (Displays
gaudy tie to audience, and then continues knitting it.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Priscilla.</span>—I am making a gift for my sister-in-law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
who is a woman of fashion, and who is fond of automobiling, so
I am knitting her a tasteful scarf which I am sure will prove
pleasing. (Shows gay muffler, and continues knitting it.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span>—What do you folks say to having a Christmas tree?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All.</span>—Fine!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span>—Well, I ain’t had a tree for years, but I think it
would be nice to trim up one to celebrate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith.</span>—That will be splendid!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span>—Then Mr. Tom you an’ Abner go out and chop
down a tree. Land sakes! Abner’s asleep an’ I never called
him till quarter past three! Abner! Wake up! Take off them
slippers, an’ put on your gum boots, an’ go chop down a tree!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner</span> (drowsily).—I ain’t George Washington! Work
again!</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>(Whistling, exeunt Abner and Tom.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span>—Now we’ll get the decorations ready. (Takes up
bowl of popcorn.) I know you young ladies will enjoy stringing
these. (Bring pail of cranberries, needles and thread.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Priscilla</span> (reluctantly).—I can hardly spare the time
from my fancy work, as I know that my sister-in-law would
be terribly disappointed if this scarf were not completed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Prudence.</span>—It is really imperative that I finish this
scarf for dear Reginald, so we will continue our knitting while
the others make ready the decorations.</p>

<p>(Enter Miss Wise, Miss Markus and Rastus the porter, the
latter carrying suit-cases.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Wise.</span>—This really is an imposition, but when we saw
the others crossing the fields to your delightful farm-house, we
thought we would follow their example.</p>

<p>(Porter sets down suit-cases and extends his hand.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Wise.</span>—Dear me, must I pay another porter?</p>

<p>(Miss Wise and Miss Markus give porter coins which he
pockets with thanks.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rastus.</span>—Dis sholy am a salubrious farm. Nice place for
chickens. I wonder if dey’s all roostin’ now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span> (nervously).—I hope Abner locked that henhouse
door!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Markus.</span>—I’m surely glad to be here, for that train
was dreadfully cold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rastus.</span>—Well I been habin’ trubbel too, for de genelman
in de diner dis mornin’ he ordered two fried eggs,—two fried
eggs he sez, one fried on one side an’ one fried on tother. I
asked him again jest natchelly thinkin’ I hadn’t heard c’rect, an’
he say “Two fried eggs, one fried on one side an’ one fried on
tother,” I done told de cook an’ he wuz dat mad he gwine pitch
me out de winder into a snow bank? Yes, sir, an’ see de black
eye he gib me! Mebbe it doan’ show but its dere all right!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span> (cordially).—I hope you ladies will feel quite at home,
and join us in our preparations for a Christmas tree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Wise.</span>—That will be lovely. Porter, take my wraps
and be careful of my Raglan coat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rastus.</span>—Yessum, I’ll shore take care of dat ragbag coat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Wise.</span>—Raglan, not ragbag!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Markus.</span>—What a relief to have finished my school
work! I had a terrific headache from correcting those papers of
mine. What do you think of answers like this? One of my
scholars in English history said that the kings were not allowed
to order taxis without the consent of Parliament.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span>—Well, it kept the rulers from being too extravagant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Wise.</span>—I told one of my young hopefuls to write a
sentence containing the word income and this was the sentence,
“I opened the door and in come the cat.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Markus.</span>—I asked a boy what gravitation was and he
said, “Gravitation is that which if there were none we should all
fly away.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Wise.</span>—I was positively discouraged with my algebra
class. One girl wrote that algebraic symbols were used when
you didn’t know what you were talking about.</p>

<p>(Abner’s whistle is heard.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Markus.</span>—O that whistling! Is that all he can
whistle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span>—Yes, and it gets on my nerves somethin’ awful
sometimes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Markus.</span>—Have you a lemon? Lemon juice is most
good for everything.</p>

<p>(Susan procures a lemon and hands it to her as Abner and
Tom enter with tree.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span>—Now, ladies and gentlemen, this is some tree. I
cannot tell a lie, I did it with my little hatchet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner.</span>—You mean I did it. That’s the way it always is, I
do the work and some other feller gets the credit of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span>—Well, Abner, I think you had better see that the
henhouse door is locked. I’d feel safer. My brother in the
South heard someone in his henhouse one night, and he went out
with a gun to investigate. He hollered out, “Hey, who’s there?”
And the third time he spoke right up an’ said he’d shoot; then a
voice came right plumb out of that henhouse an’ said, “Don’t
shoot, massa, it’s only one of us chickens.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rastus.</span>—Yas’m! I done heerd ’bout dat. He’s de genelman
what was skeert to leave de henhouse do’ open, kase de
chickens might all go home. (Rolls his eyes and laughs).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (to Rastus).—Come on, Rastus, help me up with this
tree, but remember this is a free-gratis job, no tips for this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rastus.</span>—Why sholy, Sir, I wouldn’t want no remuneration
for settin’ up a Christmas tree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span>—We’ll nail it to a board. (Takes hammer and strikes
his finger. Yells.)</p>

<p>(All speaking at once.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith.</span>—Did you hurt yourself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner.</span>—What you do it for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span>—Ain’t you hurt yourself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rastus.</span>—How did that—ar happen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span>—I did it for fun of course. O those foolish questions!
(Puts thumb in mouth. Abner begins his whistle. Miss Markus
bites top off lemon and begins sucking it (or pretends to). Abner
sees, and after a few efforts to whistle, gives up. Miss Markus
places lemon somewhere. Abner watching slyly, and when
opportunity arrives slips it in his pocket.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span>—Now all get busy and trim the tree for we have
plenty of popcorn and cranberries. Abner, hand me some of
those nice red apples to tie on the branches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner</span> (sighing).—More work! (During the following all
trim tree.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span> (severely).—Abner, I have always tried to inculcate
in you habits of industry. Do you not remember the poem
about the little busy bee?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner.</span>—Well, if any one takes me for a bee they’ll get
stung!</p>

<p>(Miss Wise and others decorate the tree with the strings of
cranberries and popcorn.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith.</span>—Abner, hand me an apple, there’s a good boy, this
branch just needs one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Wise.</span>—Abner, give me a string of cranberries, a nice
long one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner.</span>—My land! what a rest-cure this here farm is!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span>—Abner, get some string from the kitchen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith.</span>—Look out, Tom, your tipping the tree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rastus.</span>—If dere’s any tippin’ roun’ here, doan’t forget de
porter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith.</span>—Abner you’re real tall, hang that string of popcorn
there on the top branch. (Abner gets chair.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span>—Abner don’t you dare stand on that chair, you’ll
break it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Wise.</span>—Now our tree looks fine! I am proud of it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span> (suddenly).—Why how inhospitable I am! I’ve
never offered you a thing to eat and you must be half starved!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner</span> (promptly).—Yes’m, a pie and some gingerbread
would sure go good!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span>—I didn’t mean you, Abner, I meant the company.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith.</span>—I must say it sounds good to me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (enthusiastically).—Lead me to it!</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Rastus</span> (announcing).—First call for dinner in de dining car!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10.5em;">Second call for dinner in de dining car!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11.5em;">Last call for dinner in de dining car!</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span>—Abner, you can stay and redd up the sitting room
while we have supper!</p>

<p>(Exeunt all, while Abner pantomimes disgust, but takes the
lemon from his pocket, looks at it, grins, replaces it, and, whistling,
takes seat; begins to doze and nod as curtain falls.)</p>

<h2>ACT II.</h2>


<p>(Curtain rises on same scene. Abner dozing, chin on chest,
or head back, mouth open. Voice outside, “That sure was good
pie, Aunt Susan.” Abner wakens, rises.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner</span> (soliloquizing).—That’s just it! The others all in
there eatin’ pie, an’ me got to redd up the settin’ room like a
sissy! (Picks up a few articles in a discontented manner.)
Christmas tree! Much chance there is of being something for
me on that tree! I guess stinginess must run in Miss Susan’s
family, for when her brother and his wife spent Christmas here
last year, do you s’pose they brought Miss Susan a present?
Nix! Christmas morning brother says (mimicking) “Merry
Christmas, dear Susan! We wish to give you a useful gift and
no foolish trumpery, so Amelia and I decided to pay for having
your henhouse whitewashed as it needs it badly.” Then that
there generous giver he turns to me and says, “Abner, my boy
(mimicking), I do not wish to forget you, and I have noticed
that a pane in your bedroom window is broken, so I will have
it fixed at my expense.” Yessum, that there gentleman literally
and figuratively gives me a pane!</p>

<p>(Continues work, whistling over and over—)</p>

<p class="unindent">Well I s’pose now I have performed the noble duties of a
vacuum cleaner enough to satisfy Miss Susan, an’ here comes
them pie-eaters!</p>

<p>(Enter all except Aunt Susan.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith.</span>—I really think we ought to give some presents to
this dear old lady who has been so good to us. Let’s hang up
a stocking for her. Abner, you get one, there’s a good boy.</p>

<p>(Exit Abner, returns immediately with stocking, and meanwhile
guests rummage through valises for suitable gifts.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner.</span>—I’ll contribute the pair of red socks she gave me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith.</span>—How ungrateful! I’m going to put in this pretty
lace handkerchief.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Priscilla.</span>—Here’s the jelly I was going to give Uncle
Joshua. He’ll never know the difference.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span>—Right-O. What you don’t know don’t hurt you.
That’s a good motto.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rastus.</span>—Dis here am a rabbit foot, an’ it will sholy bring
de Madam good luck. An’ whenever she travels on de Limited
I’ll sholy see dat she is taken care of. I’ll steal a magazine
from de train boy, and pinch a box of chocolates when he ain’t
lookin’ an’ I’ll tell de waiter in de diner to make out her check
wrong so she gets twice as much as she pays for.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Priscilla.</span>—What a shocking sense of honor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rastus.</span>—Yes, Miss, I’m a genelman of honor, an’ when a
lady is as kind as de Madam here, I suttinly would study to pay
her back. I’d even put some of de neighbors’ hens in her henhouse.
Here am a couple of silver spoons for de lady. (Brings
spoons from pocket.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith.</span>—(Examining spoon). C. P. R. That’s Canadian
Pacific Railroad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rastus</span> (with dignity).—No, Miss. Dat means Colored
Pusson’s Remembrance.</p>

<p>(Enter Susan.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All.</span>—Merry Christmas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith.</span>—This is a little token of appreciation of your kindness,
which we hope you will accept. (Hands stocking to Aunt
Susan.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner.</span>—Nobody says nothin’ about my kindness for workin’
overtime trampin’ out in the snow for the tree. I’ll join the hired
man’s union and strike for only sixteen hours a day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span>—Well, I never. I ain’t hung up a Christmas stocking
for forty years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith.</span>—What do you suppose became of that man in the
car with us who said he was an inventor and spent all his time
drawing on brown paper with a stubby pencil?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span>—I think he was inventing a convertible submarine,
one that could be turned into an air ship when necessary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Prudence.</span>—Maybe he has frozen to death upon the
train.</p>

<p>(Knock at door and enter Inventor.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inventor.</span>—Good evening, ladies and gentlemen! Madam,
will you permit me to avail myself of the shelter of your home?
When the other passengers left the train I was so absorbed in a
drawing I was making that I did not observe their departure
until a few minutes ago. So seeing the lights of your farm-house
I started across the snow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span>—You are very welcome. Abner, take the gentleman’s
hat and coat.</p>

<p>(Inventor hands hat and overcoat to Abner and absentmindedly
gives him a tip.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner.</span>—Thank you, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rastus.</span>—Hey you, don’t be buttin’ into Pullam porter’s work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith.</span>—Merry Christmas to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inventor.</span>—O dear me. It is Christmas isn’t it. I had
forgotten all about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rastus.</span>—Yes, sir, this am the happy Christmas time when
everybody gives presents, specially to them what has blackened
their shoes and brushed their overcoats and waited on them in
the diner. Folks gives them pussons presents like fifty cent
pieces an’ dollar bills to show their appreciation an’ gratitude.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner.</span>—Well, Rastus, you come round here this spring
and I’ll give you an asparagus tip.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inventor.</span>—Ladies, gentlemen and Rastus!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rastus.</span>—What’s dat? Ladies, gen’l’men and Rastus!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inventor.</span>—Surely. You’re not a lady, are you? Your
youth and inexperience precludes the possibility of your exercising
a gentleman’s prerogatives, and therefore having eliminated
all surrounding superfluities you remain—just Rastus;
that’s all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rastus.</span>—Jes’ so! When de wissle blows, fo’ ev’rybody
else it means dinner time, but fo’ me its jes’ twelve o’clock an’
dat’s all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inventor.</span>—Correct. To resume. Ladies, gentlemen and
Rastus. You all have contributed to the success of the Christmas
party. (To Tom.) Doubtless this young giant hewed this
mighty monarch of the forest (points to tree) and single-handed
and alone bore it upon his capacious back to this hospitable
domicile for our delectation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner.</span>—Well, I never! After all the work I done dragging
that there tree through them there drifts!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inventor</span> (continuing).—And the ladies by decorating the
tree in this most artistic manner (girls courtesy), and this estimable
friend by offering us her hospitality, so I would like to contribute
to the evening’s pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rastus.</span>—Yessir! You shall sholy contribute. Where’s a
genelman’s hat for de c’lection box!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inventor.</span>—So I will have a new invention of mine
which is in the baggage car brought here, with this lady’s kind
permission.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span>—Certainly, I am greatly interested in new inventions.
Abner, go over to the train and get the gentleman’s box. The
porter will help you. Abner, are you asleep again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner.</span>—Nothing to do till to-morrow. Plow through them
drifts again? I ain’t no snowplow, Miss Susan. Have a heart
can’t you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span>—You should be glad to do anything to give others
happiness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner.</span>—Come on, Rastus. All aboard for the North Pole.
(Go out whistling.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span>—It is such a great pleasure to have you young folks
all here, for Abner and I would have spent a very quiet Christmas
together, and this really seems like a very festive celebration.
My father was always a great hand for keeping Christmas,
and he contrived to combine generosity with economy in a very
remarkable manner. I remember one year he purchased a
china cup for my mother, and desiring to prolong her pleasure
in the gift he gave her the cup alone for Christmas and the
saucer for her birthday in April.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith.</span>—My Aunt Malvina is a great hand for giving useful
presents, and one Christmas she gave the boys a rubber doormat,
and Lilian, her little girl, a set of soup spoons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Priscilla.</span>—I’m thankful that this tie is almost completed,
and I’m sure that it will please my nephew who is most
elegant and refined in his tastes. (Exhibits tie.)</p>

<p>(Voices without are heard.)</p>

<p>“Easy there!”</p>

<p>“Hey, you, Abner. Doan you drop dat ar on my toes!”</p>

<p>“Givin’ me all the weight.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t! Hol’ on dar!”</p>

<p>“Look out, you’ll smash the door!”</p>

<p>“Easy! Whoa dar, Abner!”</p>

<p>(Enter Rastus and Abner. Draw aside curtain and reveal
Wishing Box.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rastus.</span>—Here she am, sah! Nigh as heavy as a Mogul
locomotive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner.</span>—Jiminy! My feet are cold! Where’s them slippers?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inventor.</span>—Here it is, ladies and gentlemen, the wonder of
the ages!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith.</span>—How interesting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inventor.</span>—I will explain it if you desire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Priscilla.</span>—I am sure it will be most edifying.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rastus.</span>—If there am gwine to be speechifyin’ I reckon you
an’ me had better fortify ourselves with popcorn, Abner. (Abner,
and Rastus take strings of popcorn from the tree unobserved
and eat them.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inventor</span> (as if lecturing).—Ladies and gentlemen, it
affords me great pleasure to address this cultured and intelligent
audience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rastus</span> (aside).—That’s us, Abner, cultured an’ intelligent!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inventor.</span>—My invention is the result of years of study,
experimentation and research and is destined to fill a long felt
want.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (aside).—That’s what they say about every new rat-trap,
egg-beater, dictionary, or patent hairpin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inventor.</span>—One of the secrets of the psychological unrest
which characterizes the human race is that each person desires,
in short, to be someone else. The poor man wishes he were
rich, the rich man would like to be a boy again, the young would
like to be old, and the old young. Now by means of my remarkable
invention, these wishes may be gratified either permanently
or temporarily.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith.</span>—You really mean that any one can be transformed
into somebody else by stepping into the wishing box?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inventor.</span>—Precisely, my dear young lady, and I desire to
offer as a Christmas gift to this pleasant little assembly the transformation
which each one desires.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner.</span>—Well, I wish (clapping his hand to his mouth) I
nearly put my foot into it that time!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span>—Your mouth?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith.</span>—Aunt Susan, you make the first wish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rastus.</span>—Wish for a watermelon, or a possum, or fried
chicken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span>—I know a lot of things I wanted when I was a
young girl, but I ain’t young no more. (Regretfully.) I wish
I didn’t have gray hair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inventor.</span>—You made your wish, Aunt Susan. Hop into
the box.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span> (as she gets in).—Mercy sakes, it’s all the hair I have,
I don’t want to be bald.</p>

<p>(Inventor grinds policeman’s rattle a few moments, and
assists Aunt Susan out, who now, having removed wig, has hair
in long braid.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith.</span>—What lovely hair. Do let me arrange it for you,
Aunt Susan. (Arranges hair, while next character enters box.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inventor</span> (to spinsters).—Now, ladies?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Priscilla.</span>—Well, it may be a foolish wish, but (looks
toward sister who nods) we would like to be young again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inventor.</span>—Very easily done. Step right into the magic
box.</p>

<p>(The two spinsters assisted by the porter enter the box and
emerge again, having removed cloaks and let down hair, and
are seen in girlish dresses. They look in the mirror and smile
at each other.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inventor.</span>—Now for our teachers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Wise.</span>—I have consulted my friends, and we agree
that we would rather have a year’s vacation than anything else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inventor.</span>—A sensible wish. (Draws three envelopes from
box.) Here, ladies, you will find leave of absence with salary
for a year, and trust that you will spend a delightful vacation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner.</span>—Well, I wish I could be a soap salesman so the
girls would take some notice of me, like that feller that comes
round here every once in awhile an’ sells perfumery and stuff.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inventor.</span>—Very well, young man, step into the box and
your wish shall be granted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner.</span>—Goodbye chores! And bossy cows and pigs and
chickens, I’m going on the road.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span>—Mercy! I don’t know how I can get along without
Abner. He was very troublesome sometimes but he was a helpful
boy, and a splendid hand with the pigs and chickens. (Business
of rattle, etc. Abner comes out of the box).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner.</span>—Ladies and gentlemen, permit me to bring to your
observation our famous Scrubit Soap the wonder of the century,
the marvel of the ages and the apex, acme, and ne plus ultra of
our civilization. Soap, ladies and gentlemen, soap. I appeal
to your——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith.</span>—O for pity sakes, we can’t hear ourselves think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Markus.</span>—How delightful it is to think that we won’t
have to teach for a whole year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner.</span>—Ladies, I perceive that you now have your pay
envelope. May I suggest that you devote a little of your money
to the purchase of soap? I have many varieties here. Nifty
Soap for Nice People, Pink Powder for Particular Persons, and
Diamond Dust which makes washday an occasion of rejoicing
equal to Fourth of July, Valentine or Christmas?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span>—Abner, what has come over you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inventor.</span>—It is simply my wonderful invention, madam,
and instead of being tied down to the pursuit of agriculture
which was evidently distasteful to him, he has now entered the
mercantile world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner.</span>—Miss Susan, here is Cleanup Soap for tired toilers,
especially good for farmhands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span>—Have you a little hired boy in your home?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Susan.</span>—O don’t pester me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner.</span>—Is any one here interested in a hand laundry?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Susan.</span>—Hand laundry? I should say not! Just
think of folks bein’ too plum lazy to wash their own hands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner</span> (to porter).—Rastus, here is a bleacher which I think
would help you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rastus.</span>—Massy sakes! Bleach me? I’d like to be white
all right!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inventor.</span>—Well, Rastus, you’ve made your wish. Into
the box with you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rastus.</span>—O no! Massa I was only being facetious like!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span>—A wish is a wish, into the box with you!</p>

<p>(Rushes Rastus into the box, etc. Business of rattle. The
substitute Rastus emerges.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rastus.</span>—That sholy am a wonderful box.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner.</span>—Can I sell you some skin food?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rastus.</span>—Why, I feed my mouf, I don’t feed mah skin!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (to Edith).—Why, Sis, you haven’t had your wish.
Fire away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith.</span>—It sounds silly, but I want to be a young lady, so
that I can go to parties.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inventor.</span>—Foolish child, stay young while you can. Get
into the box though.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>(Edith enters, and emerges in party dress, with fan and
flowers.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span>—Well, I wish I were a college fellow for they have no
end of a good time!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inventor.</span>—Into the box with you, young man, and we’ll
transform you into a Rah! Rah! boy in no time.</p>

<p>(Tom emerges from box with college cap, college sweater,
carrying college flag.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span>—This is fine fellows! Give three cheers for the wishing
box!</p>

<p>(Leads cheers.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner.</span>—A college education is an excellent thing but I
prefer life in the great mercantile world, and what could be more
stimulating to health, happiness and psychological contentment
than the dissemination of useful articles conducive to cheerfulness
and cleanliness which when once tried, always used. Let
me call you attention to these novelties especially appropriate
and appreciated as Christmas gifts for mothers, sisters, aunts,
cousins, wives, daughters, sweethearts, and others. Lilac Lotion
for Lovely Ladies, twenty-five cents per bottle, this trifling sum
including not only the lotion itself but bottle, cork, wrapping
paper, high grade string and advertising matter which is both
interesting and instructive.</p>

<p>(Exhibits bottle.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith.</span>—O who wants your Lilac Lotion for Lovely Ladies?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner.</span>—Correct, miss, absolutely, unreservedly and undoubtedly
correct, for there are many ladies who are not lovely.
For them I have (producing a bottle) Helps for the Homely,
First Aid to the Fat, and the Fiji Freckle-Killer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inventor</span> (pointing to Abner).—You see, ladies and gentlemen,
the complete change which my wishing box has wrought.
He’s even lost his whistle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span>—Somehow I don’t think Abner is specially improved.</p>
